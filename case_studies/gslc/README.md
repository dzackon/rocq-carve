# Generic substructural λ-calculus

This subdirectory contains a mechanization of (the implicational fragment of) a generic substructural λ-calculus, with proofs of weak normalization, preservation, progress, let-elimination, and the equivalence between the generic calculus instantiated with the linearity resource algebra and the standard linear λ-calculus.
